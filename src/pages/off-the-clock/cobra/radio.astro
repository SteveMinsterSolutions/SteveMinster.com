              <p>
                Zeus came with the factory Shaker 500 — Ford's "premium" audio system circa 2008. Six-disc CD changer, eight speakers, and an auxiliary jack if you had the right cable. For 2008, it was fine. For 2025, it was a time capsule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's the thing: I still have my massive book of CDs from high school and college. Hundreds of them. And there's a part of me that liked the ritual — flipping through the sleeves, loading the disc, hearing that mechanical whir before the music started. It felt right in a car built the same year.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the practical side won out. Every song I could ever want, every podcast, every turn-by-turn direction — all in my pocket. Bluetooth wasn't a luxury anymore; it was a safety issue. The less time I spend fumbling with a disc or squinting at a tiny screen, the more time my eyes are on the road. And after the bumper replacement, I <em>really</em> don't want to do any more body work.

              <p>
                The stock Shaker 500 head unit had to go, but the rest of the system could stay. The factory door speakers and the powered 10-inch subwoofer in the trunk were more than enough — this isn't the competition system I used to run back in the day, and at this point in life, "enough" sounds pretty good.
              </p>
              <p>
                I went with a modern head unit that gave me Bluetooth audio, hands-free calling, and a cleaner interface. Plug-and-play wiring harness, standard DIN fitment, no cutting or splicing. The goal was simple: bring the cabin into the current decade without touching the rest of the audio chain.

                This was a homecoming. I used to swap car stereos in high school and college — it was practically a rite of passage. Pop the trim, disconnect the old unit, connect the harness adapter, slide in the new one, snap the trim back on. I could probably still do it with my eyes closed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 2008 GT500's dash is straightforward. No proprietary connectors that fight you, no CANBUS drama, no modules that throw codes when you pull the factory unit. Just a clean swap.
              </p>
              <p>
                Total time: about an hour, including the part where I sat in the driver's seat testing Bluetooth pairing for longer than I needed to.

            That's three for three. Zeus has his voice (the exhaust), his face (the bumper), and now his ears (the radio). The build log will keep growing — but for now, this is a good place to pause and enjoy the drive.
